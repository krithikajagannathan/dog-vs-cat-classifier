# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Model

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and finally, dense layers with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Files

- `your_colab_notebook.ipynb`: The Colab notebook with the full project code.
- `cats_vs_dogs_model.h5`: The saved trained model.

## Running the Notebook

1. Open the Colab notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the model, and make predictions.

## Usage

To use the trained model for predictions, follow the example provided in the notebook.
